### HELP! my snowman disappeared! Please fix my CSS!!!

The snowman should look like this:

![snowman](/images/snowman.png)

* Look at all of the code in `index.html` and `style.css`
* DO NOT change any code in `index.html`
* Fix the code in `style.css` so that it is working properly
  * HINT: the code in `style.css` is mostly correct, but we are accessing the elements, ids, and classes incorrectly
